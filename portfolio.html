        <h2>Basic Web</h2>
        <p>
          Basic Web wasnâ€™t our first theme, but it was our first dive into the
          rhythm of the rest of the semester. After coming from an easy and
          overwhelming starting week. Within this theme, we had three big
          assignments, the Russian Constructivism website, the History of the
          Micro Computer website, and the Interest based website. During these
          few weeks, I learnt a lot of tools, which I was very surprised on the
          speed I was able to learn them.

        <h2>Basic UX</h2>
        <p>
          In this Theme I learnt a lot about not fully trusting my instincts,
          instead I should research and find informations and problems that will
          drive my solutions. Learning about research gave me a lot of useful
          tools that I started using even in my professional life, and learning
          about when I should be converging and when I should be diverging, gave
          me enough understanding of project management to carry on successfully
          into small projects in my life.

        <h2>Basic Animation</h2>
        <p>
          The Basic Animation theme was very interesting, because it gave me a
          lot of challenges, but I had very few tools to solve them. Having
          previous experience with JavaScript has definitely helped me when it
          came to coding, but coming up with a game structure and managing
          states, that was a completely different ball game.

        <h2>Basic Content</h2>
        <p>
          In Basic content we had a lot of opportunities to experiment with
          video content creation, it being a chance to make a story without
          words, with a time cap of 60 seconds, or making videos to a client
          trying to accommodate the clientâ€™s needs.

        <h2>Portfolio Project</h2>
        <p>
          Very meta I would say?! A portfolio that talks about itself as a
          portfolio, while being a portfolio itself. ðŸ¤¯
