        <h2 class="exp__title">A little about me and my upbringing</h2>
        <div class="exp__body">
          <p>
            I was born in Brazil, and have moved around many times, having High
            School, and Summer Camp experiences in the USA, living and working
            in New Zealand, becoming a citizen of Italy, and more. I carry my
            roots wherever I am, and I try my best not to lose my sense of self
            in other cultures, but still, take as much as I can from them. So as
            you can guess by now, I can be a warm and welcoming person, that is
            what is usually assumed with my culture, but don’t get me wrong, I
            will know if I am being used or mistreated.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was raised in a family of five people, three males and two
            females, and I am the youngest. Being the youngest gave me the
            opportunity to learn with my siblings mistakes, so I wouldn’t have
            to repeat them, and I would be able to spend time exploring other
            roads. I was always enrolled in many activities, I have played
            Basketball, I have been a circus artist, photographer, teacher and
            more.

        <h2 class="exp__title">What my past consists of</h2>
        <div class="exp__body">
          <p>
            My life was very active in terms of physical education from 2006 to
            2014, I was practicing to become a circus artist during the first
            half, then I changed my passion into basketball, which took me to
            study in an American High School. After having the High School
            experience, I came back to Brazil, and quickly started a Startup
            with my brother and a friend, we pushed our startup for almost 1
            year, until we couldn’t financially support it anymore, and neither
            get enough funding to continue.
          </p>
          <p>
            After having all these experiences, I decided to start travelling,
            and the cheapest option I could find was to travel to the USA and
            work as a Camp Counselor. Every summer from 2016 to 2019, I worked
            in summer camps, taking many different roles, from Wilderness
            Adventure Trip Guide to Sports Director in a Camp for people with
            special needs. This experience taught me a lot on how to be a
            leader, and also on how to work as a team. After the summer of 2019,
            I decided to go to New Zealand, and in there, I started another
            passion, climbing.

        <h2 class="exp__title">Why did I choose to study MMD</h2>
        <div class="exp__body">
          <p>
            Studying Multimedia Design was never a dream of mine, but being
            locked down in New Zealand made me realise I needed to pick up on a
            skill, and for some reason, I remembered I really enjoyed my time
            trying to create our Startup website, so I decided to learn
            everything again, but this time trying to understand every little
            aspect of it. I quickly fell in love with Web Design and Web
            Development, along with falling in love with my amazing girlfriend.
          </p>
          <p>
            My girlfriend, who I had just recently started dating at the time,
            is from Denmark, so I wanted to be close to her, and find a way to
            continue studying what I like, so she showed me KEA, and the
            Multimedia Design course. After failing the first attempt to get
            selected during the winter, I decided to apply once more, this time
            starting in the summer, and happily, I got accepted.
