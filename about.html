          This portfolio has the goal of showing my whole first semester
          experience, and along with that, it is to show how I came up with
          solutions to the assignments. You should expect to have a resumed
          explanation of what the goals of each assignment were, and also to
          have a step-by step demonstration on my process to solve them. Along
          with my solutions to each assignment, there will be insights of what I
          learnt and what I felt it was important to share. The assignments are
          divided into themes, so each portfolio piece is going to be
          representing one theme, and inside this page, there is going to be all
          assignments related to that specific theme. The pages are going to be
          long, so feel free to take a break, drink some coffee or tea, and come
          back to it… it is worth it. Finally, you have the chance to learn a
          bit more about me, and hopefully have an understanding of my
          personality and ambitions, you might be surprised on the way, or maybe
          get some answers for questions you’ve never had. Enjoy your
          experience.
