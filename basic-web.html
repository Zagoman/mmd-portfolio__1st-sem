        Basic Web was not our first theme, but it was our first dive into the
        rhythm of the rest of the semester. After coming from an easy and
        overwhelming starting week. Within this theme, we had three big
        assignments, the Russian Constructivism website, the History of the
        Micro Computer website, and the Interest-based website. During these few
        weeks, I learned a lot of tools, which I was very surprised at the speed
        I was able to learn them.

              The main goal of this assignment was for us to have an easy
              introduction to Interface Design and HTML Markup, along with a
              very basic approach to CSS. We had to create a website that would
              be optimised for mobile browsers, and also use the right HTML
              Semantic Tags along with the content of the page.

            <p class="art__p">
              Within this module, we learned a bit about Gestalt laws, and we
              focused a lot on contrast, and proximity, which I used in my
              website so I could separate each section properly, and make each
              paragraph look like they belonged to the heading above.
            </p>
            <p class="art__p">
              To ensure that I was following Gestalt Contrast rules, In the main
              heading of the page, I set an image as a background image, and
              used a see-through black background on top of the image, the goal
              was to make the white text pop and be readable

            <p class="art__p">
              As Our first introduction to HTML, we had to focus a lot on
              semantic markup, making sure we understood what HTML tags were,
              how to use them, and which tag to use when. We also learned a
              couple of attributes that should go along with some HTML tags,
              like the “alt” attribute, to make sure a description of the image
              would show if the image couldn’t be loaded for some reason, and
              also have a descriptive meaning to the image, so screen readers
              would have information to describe the image.

            <p class="art__p">
              With the History of the micro computer assignment, we learned a
              lot about how to structure a design, and we were introduced to
              wireframing, which was a very helpful tool to help us visualize
              how the content would be placed on the page. In this module we
              were also introduced to grid-based layouts, and how to develop
              them with CSS grids. This time the focus was only on designing
              into a desktop view, so we could have a good grasp of the
              capabilities of Grid-based layout.
            </p>
            <h3 class="art__h3">Learnings</h3>
            <h4 class="art__h4">CSS Grids</h4>
            <p class="art__p">
              I had worked with CSS grids before, but mostly with CMS platforms,
              like Webflow, so I had a bit of undestanding of its capabilities,
              but I was limited with the selection of tools the platform would
              give me. Putting CSS grids into practice wasn’t an easy task,
              since my design involved many lines going across the website, my
              first approach was to try and color the grid-gap but I wasn’t
              succesful, so my solution was to create boxes, give them border
              sizes, and place them inside of the grid, and when these borders
              wouldn’t overlap properly, I had to use negative margin to align
              them.
            </p>
            <h4 class="art__h4">Design</h4>
            <p class="art__p">
              Design-wise, I took the learning goals, and turned them into a
              very literal aesthetic, emphasizing the grid lines, and also
              taking the theme of old computers, and bringing the pixelated and
              square aspects of the era. This process wasn’t as hard as I
              expected it to be, since we had a good introduction to it with the
              wireframes, and also many examples shown to us in class.
            </p>
            <h4 class="art__h4">Gestalt and Contrast</h4>
            <p class="art__p">
              We also had a continuation of the talk about Gestalt, and with
              that, we got an introduction of how to work with white space, and
              also the importance of it within the design. With this
              information, I started paying a lot of attention to what kind of
              direction the white space was bringing the user’s eyes towards,
              and how I could change it so it would bring their attention to
              what I wanted them to look at. Although being very thoughtful
              about that, we hadn’t been introduced to testing and researching,
              so I wasn’t able to use any method of proof on whether my white
              space choices had any positive effects on the website.

              For this assignment, I chose to represent a passion of mine, which
              is climbing, but I also wanted the website to be very personal, so
              no fancy climbing language was used, it was meant to encourage
              people to give it a try. We had two weeks to complete this
              assignment, and this time, the website had to be fully responsive,
              it seemed like so much work, and at some point, I thought I wasn’t
              going to be able to finish it in time.

            <p class="art__p">
              In this module, we dove deep into colours, and how they behave
              amongst each other. We also went more into prototyping and
              different ways to design. We were introduced to the Fibonacci
              Spiral and the Fibonacci sequence, and I took advantage of that
              information when coming up with my typography hierarchy. My
              typography was scaled using the Fibonacci numbers, so they could
              be visually apart from each other, and yet they would still be
              interesting. I used my font-size scaling from 16, 32, 48, 80, 128…

            <h4 class="art__h4">Style Tile</h4>
            <p class="art__p">
              Before we came up with our full design, we had to make a style
              tile. Although I didn’t make much use out of it when designing, I
              sure used it to set my base settings while coding, making sure the
              typography was following the ratios set in the file, that the
              colours would be the same, and also that the hover effects would
              behave as described
            </p>
            <h4 class="art__h4">Testing Methods</h4>
            <p class="art__p">
              In this module we were also introduced to some testing methods,
              like the 5 seconds test, that gave us the information on whether
              it is easy to understand the main goal of our page or not, and we
              were also introduced to the Trunk Test, which was a very
              methodical test, and had to be executed in a very formal way. The
              Trunk Test gave us information on whether our websites were easy
              to navigate, or not.
