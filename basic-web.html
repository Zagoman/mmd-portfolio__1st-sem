        Basic Web was not our first theme, but it was our first dive into the
        rhythm of the rest of the semester. After coming from an easy and
        overwhelming starting week. Within this theme, we had three big
        assignments, the Russian Constructivism website, the History of the
        Micro Computer website, and the Interest-based website. During these few
        weeks, I learned a lot of tools, which I was very surprised at the speed
        I was able to learn them.

            The main goal of this assignment was for us to have an easy
            introduction to Interface Design and HTML Markup, along with a very
            basic approach to CSS. We had to create a website that would be
            optimised for mobile browsers, and also use the right HTML Semantic
            Tags along with the content of the page.

          <h4 class="art__h4">Gestalt</h4>
          <p class="art__p">
            Within this module, we learned a bit about Gestalt laws, and we
            focused a lot on contrast, and proximity, which I used in my website
            so I could separate each section properly, and make each paragraph
            look like they belonged to the heading above.
          </p>
          <p class="art__p">
            To ensure that I was following Gestalt Contrast rules, In the main
            heading of the page, I set an image as a background image, and used
            a see-through black background on top of the image, the goal was to
            make the white text pop and be readable

          <h4 class="art__h4">HTML</h4>
          <p class="art__p">
            As Our first introduction to HTML, we had to focus a lot on semantic
            markup, making sure we understood what HTML tags were, how to use
            them, and which tag to use when. We also learned a couple of
            attributes that should go along with some HTML tags, like the “alt”
            attribute, to make sure a description of the image would show if the
            image couldn’t be loaded for some reason, and also have a
            descriptive meaning to the image, so screen readers would have
            information to describe the image.

          <h2 class="art__h2">History of the micro computer</h2>
          <p class="art__p">
            With the History of the micro computer assignment, we learned a lot
            about how to structure a design, and we were introduced to
            wireframing, which was a very helpful tool to help us visualize how
            the content would be placed on the page. In this module we were also
            introduced to grid-based layouts, and how to develop them with CSS
            grids. This time the focus was only on designing into a desktop
            view, so we could have a good grasp of the capabilities of
            Grid-based layout.
          </p>
          <h3 class="art__h3">Learnings</h3>
          <h4 class="art__h4">CSS Grids</h4>
          <p class="art__p">
            I had worked with CSS grids before, but mostly with CMS platforms,
            like Webflow, so I had a bit of undestanding of its capabilities,
            but I was limited with the selection of tools the platform would
            give me. Putting CSS grids into practice wasn’t an easy task, since
            my design involved many lines going across the website, my first
            approach was to try and color the grid-gap but I wasn’t succesful,
            so my solution was to create boxes, give them border sizes, and
            place them inside of the grid, and when these borders wouldn’t
            overlap properly, I had to use negative margin to align them.
          </p>
          <h4 class="art__h4">Design</h4>
          <p class="art__p">
            Design-wise, I took the learning goals, and turned them into a very
            literal aesthetic, emphasizing the grid lines, and also taking the
            theme of old computers, and bringing the pixelated and square
            aspects of the era. This process wasn’t as hard as I expected it to
            be, since we had a good introduction to it with the wireframes, and
            also many examples shown to us in class.
          </p>
          <h4 class="art__h4">Gestalt and Contrast</h4>
          <p class="art__p">
            We also had a continuation of the talk about Gestalt, and with that,
            we got an introduction of how to work with white space, and also the
            importance of it within the design. With this information, I started
            paying a lot of attention to what kind of direction the white space
            was bringing the user’s eyes towards, and how I could change it so
            it would bring their attention to what I wanted them to look at.
            Although being very thoughtful about that, we hadn’t been introduced
            to testing and researching, so I wasn’t able to use any method of
            proof on whether my white space choices had any positive effects on
            the website.

          <h2 class="art__h2">Interest Based Website</h2>
          <p class="art__p">
            For this assignment, I chose to represent a passion of mine, which
            is climbing, but I also wanted the website to be very personal, so
            no fancy climbing language was used, it was meant to encourage
            people to give it a try. We had two weeks to complete this
            assignment, and this time, the website had to be fully responsive,
            it seemed like so much work, and at some point, I thought I wasn’t
            going to be able to finish it in time.
          </p>
          <h3 class="art__h3">Learnings</h3>
          <h4 class="art__h4">Typography</h4>
          <p class="art__p">
            In this module, we dove deep into colours, and how they behave
            amongst each other. We also went more into prototyping and different
            ways to design. We were introduced to the Fibonacci Spiral and the
            Fibonacci sequence, and I took advantage of that information when
            coming up with my typography hierarchy. My typography was scaled
            using the Fibonacci numbers, so they could be visually apart from
            each other, and yet they would still be interesting. I used my
            font-size scaling from 16, 32, 48, 80, 128…
          </p>
          <h4 class="art__h4">Style Tile</h4>
          <p class="art__p">
            Before we came up with our full design, we had to make a style tile.
            Although I didn’t make much use out of it when designing, I sure
            used it to set my base settings while coding, making sure the
            typography was following the ratios set in the file, that the
            colours would be the same, and also that the hover effects would
            behave as described
          </p>
          <h4 class="art__h4">Testing Methods</h4>
          <p class="art__p">
            In this module we were also introduced to some testing methods, like
            the 5 seconds test, that gave us the information on whether it is
            easy to understand the main goal of our page or not, and we were
            also introduced to the Trunk Test, which was a very methodical test,
            and had to be executed in a very formal way. The Trunk Test gave us
            information on whether our websites were easy to navigate, or not.
