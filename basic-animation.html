        The Basic Animation theme was very interesting because it gave me a lot
        of challenges, but I had very few tools to solve them. Having previous
        experience with JavaScript has definitely helped me when it came to
        coding, but coming up with a game structure and managing states, was a
        completely different ball game.

          <p class="art__p">
            Going straight into paper prototyping before even being 100% sure on
            an idea was a challenge, I didn’t have much idea of how my game had
            to work, but I had a few basic concepts that I wanted to be present.
            The paper prototype gave me insights that I needed to add more UI
            elements, and also made me realise that sound would be key to
            portraying which character was bad and which character was good.

          <h4 class="art__h4">Character Design</h4>
          <p class="art__p">
            Designing the characters was a long task, and at this point in the
            course, I was still very uncomfortable with Adobe Illustrator. We
            had many classes on different aspects of game design, and one that
            stuck to my head, was the babyface bias, that you needed to create a
            character with a big head and forehead, and small face features.
            Having the babyface bias would mean that my design would be
            approachable, and not scary, but I chose not to go too extreme with
            it since the bad character would be a robot version of the good
            character.
          </p>
          <h4 class="art__h4">UI Design</h4>
          <p class="art__p">
            UI elements were a big part of our design because we needed to set a
            mood with the whole background design, but we needed functionality
            as well, and the buttons to perform some actions couldn’t be looking
            like they didn’t belong in that environment. To design my platform,
            I decided to go with a 50s Poster style, where I would use faded
            colours, ripping edges, and box shadows, I also added some texture
            to the background, so it would look faded, contrasting the
            futuristic-looking buildings.
          </p>
          <h4 class="art__h4">Sound Design</h4>
          <p class="art__p">
            For the sound design, I used Adobe Audition to create the sound
            mixing and edits, and for one of the sounds, I had to record a
            Trimmer, a masking tape, a guitar, and a tap on the table. The
            combination of these sounds would give the impression of being
            shocked, and this sound was used when clicking a robot item.

            I learned a lot with coding the website, and most of these learnings
            surrounded state management. Multiple times in my code, I would have
            bugs that I didn’t see coming, like the clock not stopping when I
            needed it to, due to the setTimeout function never stopping to being
            called inside my recursive function, therefore I had to create a
            boolean variable to tell this timing function if the game was
            running or not.

          <p class="art__p">
            I faced organisation challenges as well, at the beginning, I didn’t
            want to follow the SMD to code, I just wanted to solve problems as
            they showed, but then they never stopped appearing. After these
            challenges was when I decided to accept the SMD as my crutch, and I
            relied on it heavily, making my job a lot easier.

            The whole goal of the game was to turn this character called
            Zuckerberg into a human, by collecting emotions and avoiding any
            sort of electronics or robots. I chose to have a life display based
            on the Chicken-o-meter, and my version of it consisted of having
            Zuckerberg’s face shifting between fully human and fully robot, with
            steps in between.

          <p class="art__p">
            The feedback with the game was nice, and also very useful since I
            found that the game was too easy to win at the end and that I should
            make it more difficult.
