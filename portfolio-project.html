          <h2>Preparation</h2>
          <p>
            My goal when I started the portfolio was to be as methodic as I
            could about the process. The process would consist of doing all the
            style research, coming up with a mood board, followed by the style
            tile, and doing the home page design to see how I would accommodate
            the content I would write. It turns out that all this structure
            stressed me out, and I found myself without doing any of the tasks
            during the entirety of two days. After those two days, I decided to
            code the home page design I had come up with, and I am very thankful
            I did, so I could find that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do what I wanted
            in time.

          <h2>Design</h2>
          <h3>Inspiration</h3>
          <p>
            I tend to find inspiration within graphic design, and the use of
            typography, so to represent this taste, I wanted to find a graphic
            design movement that I could study, and potentially have my design
            following the same ideas. During this Desk Research, I found a
            timeline that had many artistic movements represented, and I quickly
            identified the Swiss Style, and I decided to go with it.
          </p>
          <h3>Layout</h3>
          <p>
            Studying the Swiss Style, I found that the layouts were heavily
            dependent on grids, and it had a lot of white space. The style
            contains very simple sans-serif typography, but it is projected in
            big and bold letters, contrasted with a lot smaller but yet bold
            text and subtitles. With so much white space, a lot of the content
            ‚Äúfloat‚Äù on the page, but they have, what I like to call, an
            ‚Äúanchor‚Äù, which usually is another design element or piece of text,
            that shares the same line of the grid in a vertical or horizontal
            setting, giving it some invisible structure lines. I also chose to
            go with very simple geometric shapes, triangles, circles, and
            squares.
          </p>
          <h3>Frustration Point</h3>
          <p>
            I was very excited about the design I was coming up with, and I had
            many vibrant and bright colours, which I usually try to avoid, and I
            was using a technique of blending the colours with blending modes,
            Multiply and Color-burn to be exact. That is where the development
            fell apart, when I brought the design into coding, I wasn‚Äôt able to
            replicate the blending modes properly, and neither was I able to
            scale the vector graphics how I wanted. At that point, I made the
            decision to ditch that design, and I am happy I did it.
          </p>
          <h3>The New Design</h3>
          <p>
            The new design follows many of the same concepts, it uses a lot of
            white space, has good grid structure, has bold and simple
            typography, and still keeps the geometric shapes, but this time, no
            blending modes. The design is relying on the white spaces, to give
            some breathing opportunities, the proximity between related content,
            to make sure they look like they belong together, the visual
            hierarchy between font-sizes, and the grid layout. The closure
            technique is used to simulate a circle on the main home image, where
            I stand in the background with a small part of a circle behind me.

          <h2>Content</h2>
          <h3>Target Audience</h3>
          <p>
            Having you, teachers, as my target audience, was very interesting,
            since I knew that I could go deep into what made me make some
            choices, instead of spending too much on real estate trying to
            explain what the project itself was. Although knowing that we were
            together for the whole semester, I could not assume you knew
            everything we‚Äôve been through, since not the same teachers were
            teaching every single theme, so I still needed to cover some ground
            on the explanation of the assignment.
          </p>
          <h3>User Experience</h3>
          <p>
            I knew from the beginning that the website would be full of content
            and that it would be really difficult to read if it was laid out
            like a document. My approach to solving this problem was to give the
            content titles and subtitles, so you can find the information you
            want faster and easier. I have also adopted some design choices that
            users are used to when browsing the internet, like having the
            navigation on the top right of the page, the logo redirecting to the
            home page, and having current pages being highlighted both in the
            footer and the navigation bar.
          </p>
          <p>
            After having my girlfriend check out my website, she noticed that it
            wasn‚Äôt intuitive to go from one portfolio piece to another. To fix
            this issue, I have created a section at the end of each portfolio
            piece to redirect the user to the next or previous piece.

          <h2>Development</h2>
          <h3>HTML</h3>
          <h4>Semantic Markup</h4>
          <p>
            Making sure the content was semantically correct or as close to it
            as I could get was a big focus of mine. Although not 100% necessary
            when it comes to designing the page, and also not having the goal of
            performing well when it comes to SEO, it was very important to me to
            get it right, since it was one of our biggest focuses on the first
            module of Basic Web. Another reason to have it well done was to
            improve the user experience, foreseeing when each information would
            be needed (Like adding abbr tag when an abbreviation comes up).

          <h3>CSS</h3>
          <h4>Variables</h4>
          <p>
            I wanted to have a lot of control over most of the elements of my
            design, and they would include spacings, colours and font sizes. To
            make sure I wouldn‚Äôt have to go in every item that used the same
            colour, and change them into new colours one by one, I created CSS
            variables and used them as much as I could, giving me a lot of
            control, and giving me easy access to them, since they were placed
            at the beginning of the file.
          </p>
          <h4>Responsiveness</h4>
          <p>
            To make my page responsive, I made use of a technique called Column
            Dropping, where my design wouldn‚Äôt shift much when reduced to
            smaller screens, but whatever was displayed in a horizontal view, is
            now displayed in a vertical view, by dropping the number of columns
            in the design, and pushing the overflowing items into the next row.

          <h3>JS</h3>
          <h4>Burger Menu</h4>
          <p>
            My only use for JavaScript in this project was to toggle the burger
            menu in the mobile views. It was a very easy implementation, making
            sure that whenever the burger menu button was clicked, the state of
            the navigation links container would change, by toggling a hidden
            class, and also giving the body HTML element the attribute
            ‚Äúoverflow: hidden‚Äù so the user wouldn‚Äôt be able to scroll when the
            burger menu was open.

          <h3>Git + GitHub</h3>
          <h4>GitHub Actions</h4>
          <p>
            I was frustrated with how FileZilla worked as our tool to upload our
            content to our domain, so I decided to research how to automate it.
            My goal was to have the page being updated with the new content
            every time I would push content into the main branch of my GitHub
            repository. I found a youtube video that explained exactly how to do
            that, using GitHub Actions, connecting it to my FTP Handles, and
            connecting the repository with the domain.
