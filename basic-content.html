        In Basic content we had a lot of opportunities to experiment with video
        content creation, it being a chance to make a story without words, with
        a time cap of 60 seconds, or making videos to a client trying to
        accommodate the client’s needs.

          <h3>A story without words</h3>
          <p>
            In this module, we were introduced to basic techniques of video
            making and video editing. Being presented with very few notes on
            video making and storytelling, gave me a certain doubt in whether I
            could come up with something creative, but I believe the constraints
            worked as a way to drive me into a creative mindset, and a
            storyteller. I was able to create a video with a deep meaning, and I
            was able to share my message in under 60 seconds, which made it so
            much more useful since there would be more people willing to watch
            the content.
          </p>
          <p>
            I didn’t get to experience many close-ups, since they weren’t needed
            to share my point across the video, but I was able to use some
            middle shots, to set the environment along with showing my emotions,
            actions, and reactions. The addition of sound wasn’t complex, since
            I didn’t need much more than ambient sound, and a police car siren
            sound.

          <h2>Client brief</h2>
          <p>
            Preparing for the client meeting was an interesting experience,
            since most of the things I was worried about beforehand (like
            technical questions), the clients weren’t so interested in. I had
            spent a big amount of time thinking about whether the video should
            be displayed on Facebook rather than on Instagram, and thinking
            about details of how to handle the videos/website to them. What I
            learned from this experience is that I didn’t take much of the
            problem into consideration, and went straight into trying to figure
            out what solution they would like best.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’ve had many client meetings before having the one we had in class,
            and none of them was like this one, because most of the time the
            meetings were just me and my clients, I didn’t have other 50
            classmates with me to ask questions. Needless to say, I wouldn’t
            have much control over the situation, or which direction I wanted to
            direct the meeting towards, since I had no clue what the next
            question would be, or when I would have the opportunity to ask
            another question.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the client interview, I learned a lot about their priorities,
            goals, and struggles. They showed that they wouldn’t have much time
            to spend on the project themselves, therefore we tried to minimize
            the amount of input we would need from them after the meeting, so in
            consequence, we spent a lot of time planning, brainstorming and
            diverging, before we could settle into finally converging and
            driving our project into a concrete solution.

          <h2>Personas</h2>
          <p>
            Personas were one of the most important things I learned in this
            theme. I was able to understand the importance of being able to
            relate to someone when it comes to making decisions that could
            benefit them. Personas are a data-driven representation of a
            non-existent person that could belong to one of the target groups of
            the product.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this project we went with two personas, Maya and Bjørn, they were
            very different from each other, and also represented two different
            target groups. Maya was a young Italian lady, studying finance at
            CBS, she was busy with school, but would be able to take the
            opportunity to meet people at the fridge, or donate to local people.
            Bjørn was different, he was an older man, in his 60s, he was widowed
            and wanted a way to interact with other people, so he would donate
            and volunteer at the fridge whenever he could with his Christiania
            bike.

          <h2>Pre-production</h2>
          <p>
            After coming up with a few video ideas, we had to dial down to have
            just a few, to make sure we would have time to execute them all. To
            select the two videos we were going to shoot, we made an impact
            analysis, to be able to understand how our personas would be
            affected by each video, and if the video made sense to the target
            audience of the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            After selecting the videos, we were introduced to the Story Board,
            where we had to have very detailed information about each shot we
            would shoot on the shooting day. So as a group effort, we met down
            at Absalon and came up with the Story Board together. I decided on
            using a tool that I found on the internet to create the storyboard,
            and although it looked good, it wasn’t representing our idea of each
            shot properly (According to feedback).
          </p>
          <p>
            I also learned the importance of preparing beforehand, since we had
            made a Story Board, but we hadn’t anticipated all the obstacles we
            would have. An example of not preparing too well, was in the shots
            we had to do at the fridge, we didn’t that there would be so many
            people there, and they would be in the shot.

          <h2>Customer Pitch</h2>
          <p>
            We had to present our Customer Pitch twice, due to the clients not
            being able to be present on the scheduled day. Although
            inconvenient, it was really nice to have the opportunity to present
            it to a teacher beforehand, and get feedback and have the
            opportunity to do a better job.
          </p>
          <p>
            We used the PetchaKutcha presentation method, which consists of 20
            slides of 20 seconds each, with that constraint we were able to make
            our presentation focused only on important points, and ditching
            small and irrelevant details, like what each of the group members
            did, and what method we used where. We took the decisions on what to
            cut and what to keep based on the fact that we would be presenting
            to the clients, and not to the teachers.

          <h2>A website with a video</h2>
          <p>
            Designing the website was a joined task, we wanted to be able to get
            as many people on big decisions as we could, but keep not so many
            people executing on them at a single time, since we had so many
            other tasks to complete. We chose to go with a looping video on the
            home page, choosing to keep the message on the pathos side,
            appealing to the emotional side of viewers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our website had bright and vibrant colours, which were a request
            from the client’s brief, but we changed their original colours since
            they made their brand look outdated and not so pleasing. Our logo
            gives the idea of sharing, but not only food since the clients think
            about expanding their impact shortly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our second video shows someone walking alone, with a bag of food,
            this person is initially sad, but then turns happy once she is
            presented with the opportunity of donating and joining a
            volunteering community. Our whole idea for this video was to show
            the sense of community, showing the viewers how good it actually is
            to donate, and also how good it is to volunteer and participate in a
            community of people who are trying to make their community a better
            place.
