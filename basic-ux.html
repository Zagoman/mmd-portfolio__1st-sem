        In this Theme I learned a lot about not fully trusting my instincts,
        instead, I should research and find information and problems that will
        drive my solutions. Learning about research gave me a lot of useful
        tools that I started using even in my professional life, and learning
        about when I should be converging and when I should be diverging, gave
        me enough understanding of project management to carry on successfully
        into small projects in my life.

            <p class="art__p">
              In this module we were introduced to many research types, them
              being Desk Research, Observation Research, Interview, and Survey.
              We used all these methods to grab as much information as we could
              so we could come up with a solution to a UX Problem inside of a
              T-shirt selling business. In this module, I chose to dive into
              t-shirt production aspects, and find flaws and aspects that needed
              Improvement.

            <h4 class="art__h4">Research</h4>
            <p class="art__p">
              I used Desk Research, which is a method of finding information
              that has already been researched by others, to find information
              about t-shirt production and to find UX problems into which I
              would like to dive deeper into in future assignments. I found
              information about the industry’s wasteful ways to come up with the
              clothing you see at the stores, regardless of whether the store
              lives in an online environment, or in a physical space.
            </p>
            <h4 class="art__h4">Findings</h4>
            <p class="art__p">
              For the assignment we had, I didn’t find much use for the
              Observation Research, since most of the data I acquired was
              quantitative, and not having done the research for a long period
              might not have given me any taste or preferences direct related to
              a specific demographic. Perhaps the most useful data I found was
              that 60% of the people wearing t-shirts that day were male, but we
              didn’t find the data trustworthy enough to base our future product
              on this fact.

              In my opinion, this part of the Theme was one the most useful ones
              and was crucial in keeping the team working towards the same goal.
              We had multiple activities, that later on the theme was separated
              into Convergent and Divergent categories. Some of these activities
              were Lightning Demos, Crazy 8s, Sketching, Brainstorming...

            <h4 class="art__h4">Project Management</h4>
            <p class="art__p">
              Having a go with a team for the first time in the semester was a
              bit scary, but quickly everything fell into place with the fast
              brainstorming activities we had to do. Having specific ways to
              brainstorm gave us more direction, and gave us the control that we
              needed to come up with a solution that made sense. I was chosen to
              be in charge of Project Management, even though we hadn’t gone too
              in-depth into this aspect. One of the most important things I
              learned performing this role, was to be able to step back in minor
              decisions (like minimal design choices, and colour choosing), and
              to be able to look at the bigger picture of where we are within
              our goals, and what else needs to be done or planned to reach it.
            </p>
            <h4 class="art__h4">Storyboarding</h4>
            <p class="art__p">
              A storyboard is a tool that helps us to understand who is going to
              be using our project, and the actions this user is going to be
              taking. We created our storyboard with the findings that we had of
              most of the people using their phones to reach clothing websites.
              Our storyboard starts with our user finding an Ad of our product
              being worn by one of their favourite artists, then the user clicks
              on the ad, entering our website and performing all the purchasing
              flow.
            </p>
            <h4 class="art__h4">Think Aloud Test</h4>
            <p class="art__p">
              We also had the privilege to do a Think Aloud Test, which we found
              very useful. The think-aloud test is made for us to be able to see
              the user interacting with our solution, and in this phase, the
              product we had tested was our paper prototype, which gave us a lot
              of insights on buttons sizes, purchase flow, and usage.

            <h2 class="art__h2">Solution</h2>
            <p class="art__p">
              Coming up with our solution based on facts and data wasn’t an easy
              task, but it taught me a lot about not jumping to conclusions, and
              also not assuming that we have any answers.
            </p>
            <p class="art__p">
              We created a webshop in a mobile version since our target audience
              would be finding us through social media artists on Instagram, and
              other media. We would only display 6 t-shirts from each of the 2
              current artists, and all the t-shirts would be pre-order. These
              choices were made with the conscious decision of decreasing the
              textile waste, by only producing what was going to go to the
              consumer’s closet. Giving the users limitations was our solution
              to stop doom scrolling in these platforms, and also to decrease
              the indecisiveness factor.

            <p class="art__p">
              Creating a pitch deck was interesting, we worked hard to create a
              story, so it wouldn’t be a boring slideshow presentation. We used
              tools that were presented to us, like the dramaturgical graph that
              shows where you should place the Climax, the hook, the PONR, and
              where we should have the mounting tension. These graphics along
              with the hero’s journey helped us to have an interesting
              presentation while giving enough information to keep the audience
              hooked.
